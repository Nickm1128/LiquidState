# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to clean up legacy code in the LSM (Liquid State Machine) project and create a new convenience layer that makes creating and using LSM models as simple as scikit-learn. The goal is to provide a streamlined, user-friendly API that abstracts away the complexity of the current multi-component architecture while maintaining all the advanced capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to create and train LSM models with a simple, scikit-learn-like API, so that I can quickly experiment with LSM architectures without dealing with complex configuration details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports the convenience API THEN they SHALL be able to create an LSM model with a single class instantiation
2. WHEN a user calls fit() on an LSM model THEN the system SHALL automatically handle data preprocessing, tokenization, and training pipeline orchestration
3. WHEN a user calls predict() on a trained LSM model THEN the system SHALL return predictions using the most appropriate inference method
4. IF a user provides minimal parameters THEN the system SHALL use intelligent defaults for reservoir configuration, CNN architecture, and training parameters
5. WHEN a user wants to customize model architecture THEN they SHALL be able to pass configuration parameters similar to scikit-learn's parameter style

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want legacy and redundant code removed from the project, so that the codebase is cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy code is identified THEN it SHALL be removed if it's no longer used or has been superseded by enhanced versions
2. WHEN duplicate functionality exists THEN the system SHALL consolidate to use the most advanced implementation
3. WHEN root-level scripts exist that duplicate functionality in the organized src/ structure THEN they SHALL be removed or refactored
4. IF legacy code is still needed for backward compatibility THEN it SHALL be clearly marked and documented as deprecated
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all remaining code SHALL have clear purpose and no dead code paths

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner, I want the convenience API to support both simple and advanced use cases, so that I can start simple and gradually access more sophisticated features as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs basic functionality THEN they SHALL be able to use the API with just fit() and predict() methods
2. WHEN a user needs advanced features THEN they SHALL be able to access system message processing, different reservoir types, and CNN architectures through parameters
3. WHEN a user wants to inspect model internals THEN they SHALL have access to underlying components through the convenience wrapper
4. IF a user needs custom preprocessing THEN they SHALL be able to provide custom tokenizers or data loaders
5. WHEN a user wants to save/load models THEN they SHALL be able to use simple save() and load() methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the convenience API to maintain access to all advanced LSM features, so that I can still leverage the full power of the system while benefiting from the simplified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies advanced reservoir types THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical, attentive, echo state, and deep reservoir variants
2. WHEN a user enables system message processing THEN the convenience API SHALL integrate SystemMessageProcessor and EmbeddingModifierGenerator
3. WHEN a user chooses 3D CNN processing THEN the system SHALL automatically configure CNN3DProcessor with appropriate parameters
4. IF a user needs response-level generation THEN the convenience API SHALL provide access to ResponseGenerator functionality
5. WHEN a user wants batch processing THEN the system SHALL support efficient batch operations through the convenience interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the project, I want the project structure reorganized for clarity, so that the codebase follows clear separation of concerns and is easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the convenience layer is implemented THEN it SHALL be placed in a dedicated src/lsm/convenience/ directory
2. WHEN legacy files are removed THEN the project root SHALL only contain essential configuration files and documentation
3. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible through the src/lsm package structure
4. IF examples need updating THEN they SHALL demonstrate both the convenience API and direct component usage
5. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL clearly explain the convenience API alongside the existing detailed API

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user migrating from other ML libraries, I want familiar method names and patterns, so that I can quickly understand and use the LSM convenience API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a model THEN they SHALL use familiar methods like fit(), predict(), and score()
2. WHEN a user sets parameters THEN they SHALL use a consistent parameter naming convention similar to scikit-learn
3. WHEN a user needs model information THEN they SHALL be able to access attributes like feature_names_in_, classes_, and model metadata
4. IF a user wants to clone or copy a model THEN they SHALL have access to standard methods for model duplication
5. WHEN a user works with the API THEN error messages SHALL be clear and provide actionable guidance

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the LSM tokenizer/embedder system to support sinusoidal embeddings with any tokenizer backend and streaming data processing for large datasets. The goal is to create a flexible, high-performance tokenization and embedding system that can handle massive datasets efficiently while maintaining compatibility with the existing convenience API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to use any tokenizer (HuggingFace, OpenAI, custom) with sinusoidal embeddings, so that I can leverage pre-trained tokenizers while benefiting from sinusoidal position encoding for better temporal modeling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies a tokenizer type THEN the system SHALL support HuggingFace transformers, OpenAI tiktoken, spaCy, and custom tokenizers
2. WHEN a user fits the tokenizer-embedder THEN the system SHALL automatically create a sinusoidal embedding layer that maps tokens to sinusoidal representations
3. WHEN tokens are processed THEN the system SHALL apply sinusoidal transformations based on token position and frequency characteristics
4. IF a user provides a custom tokenizer THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt the sinusoidal embedding layer to match the tokenizer's vocabulary size
5. WHEN the embedder is trained THEN it SHALL learn optimal frequency parameters for the sinusoidal transformations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer working with large datasets, I want streaming data support during tokenizer fitting, so that I can process datasets that don't fit in memory without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dataset is too large for memory THEN the system SHALL support streaming data processing with configurable batch sizes
2. WHEN processing streaming data THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent tokenization and embedding quality across batches
3. WHEN fitting on streaming data THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking and memory usage monitoring
4. IF memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust batch sizes and processing parameters
5. WHEN streaming processing completes THEN the fitted tokenizer-embedder SHALL be equivalent to batch processing results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the convenience API, I want the enhanced tokenizer to integrate seamlessly with existing LSM models, so that I can upgrade tokenization without changing my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using LSMGenerator, LSMClassifier, or LSMRegressor THEN users SHALL be able to specify the enhanced tokenizer through parameters
2. WHEN the enhanced tokenizer is used THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing model save/load functionality
3. WHEN switching tokenizers THEN the system SHALL provide automatic migration utilities for existing models
4. IF a user wants to compare tokenizers THEN the system SHALL provide benchmarking utilities
5. WHEN using the convenience API THEN the enhanced tokenizer SHALL work with all existing preprocessing and data handling features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want configurable sinusoidal embedding parameters, so that I can experiment with different frequency patterns and embedding dimensions for optimal model performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring sinusoidal embeddings THEN users SHALL be able to specify base frequencies, scaling factors, and embedding dimensions
2. WHEN training the embedder THEN the system SHALL support learnable frequency parameters alongside fixed sinusoidal patterns
3. WHEN using different embedding dimensions THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust sinusoidal patterns to maintain mathematical properties
4. IF users want positional encoding THEN the system SHALL support both absolute and relative positional sinusoidal embeddings
5. WHEN experimenting with parameters THEN the system SHALL provide visualization tools for embedding patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want efficient memory management and caching, so that tokenization and embedding operations don't become bottlenecks in my training pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large vocabularies THEN the system SHALL use memory-efficient embedding storage and computation
2. WHEN tokenizing repeated text THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching to avoid redundant computations
3. WHEN using GPU acceleration THEN the system SHALL optimize sinusoidal computations for parallel processing
4. IF memory constraints exist THEN the system SHALL support gradient checkpointing and memory-mapped embeddings
5. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL vectorize operations for maximum throughput

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data scientist working with multilingual data, I want the tokenizer to handle diverse text formats and languages, so that I can build models that work across different linguistic contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multilingual text THEN the system SHALL support Unicode normalization and language-specific tokenization rules
2. WHEN handling different text formats THEN the system SHALL support structured data (JSON, XML) and plain text with automatic format detection
3. WHEN working with special tokens THEN the system SHALL preserve and properly embed system tokens, padding tokens, and custom markers
4. IF text contains mixed languages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent embedding quality across language boundaries
5. WHEN processing code or technical text THEN the system SHALL handle special characters and formatting appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the enhanced tokenizer implementation to maintain clean project organization, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN the project directory SHALL be clean with no temporary files, unused imports, or dead code
2. WHEN new tokenizer components are added THEN they SHALL follow the established src/lsm/ package structure and naming conventions
3. WHEN code is organized THEN it SHALL have clear separation of concerns between tokenization, embedding, and streaming functionality
4. IF new dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be properly documented in requirements.txt and pyproject.toml
5. WHEN the feature is complete THEN all code SHALL pass linting, formatting, and type checking standards

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer using the LSM library, I want comprehensive documentation for the enhanced tokenizer, so that I can understand and effectively use all the new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include API documentation for all new tokenizer classes and methods
2. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate both basic usage and advanced configuration options
3. WHEN tutorials are created THEN they SHALL show integration with the convenience API and streaming data processing
4. IF migration is needed THEN documentation SHALL provide clear upgrade paths from existing tokenizer usage
5. WHEN troubleshooting guides are written THEN they SHALL cover common issues with streaming data and sinusoidal embeddings

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user of the convenience API, I want the enhanced tokenizer to integrate seamlessly with existing LSM functionality, so that I can access new features without breaking existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced tokenizer is implemented THEN it SHALL integrate with LSMGenerator, LSMClassifier, and LSMRegressor through existing parameter interfaces
2. WHEN using convenience API methods THEN users SHALL be able to specify sinusoidal tokenizer options through familiar parameter patterns
3. WHEN models are saved and loaded THEN the enhanced tokenizer configuration SHALL be preserved and restored correctly
4. IF existing convenience API examples exist THEN they SHALL be updated to demonstrate the new tokenizer options
5. WHEN the integration is complete THEN all existing convenience API tests SHALL continue to pass with backward compatibility maintained

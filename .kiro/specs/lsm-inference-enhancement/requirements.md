# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines enhancements to the Sparse Sine-Activated Liquid State Machine (LSM) project to enable complete inference capability. The current system can train models but lacks proper persistence of tokenizers, text decoding capabilities, and comprehensive model state management. These enhancements will create a fully functional inference pipeline that can load trained models and perform next-token prediction with human-readable text input/output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Tokenizer Persistence

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tokenizer to be automatically saved and loaded with the model, so that I can perform inference without needing to retrain or refit the tokenizer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is saved THEN the fitted tokenizer SHALL be serialized and saved alongside the model files
2. WHEN a model is loaded THEN the tokenizer SHALL be automatically deserialized and restored to its fitted state
3. WHEN the tokenizer is saved THEN all vocabulary, feature mappings, and configuration parameters SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN the tokenizer is loaded THEN it SHALL be immediately ready for encoding/decoding without additional fitting

### Requirement 2: Text Decoding Capability

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive human-readable text predictions from the model, so that I can understand and use the model's output effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model produces an embedding prediction THEN the system SHALL convert it back to readable text
2. WHEN multiple candidate predictions are available THEN the system SHALL select the most appropriate text representation
3. WHEN the embedding cannot be decoded precisely THEN the system SHALL provide the closest matching text from the vocabulary
4. WHEN decoding fails THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message or fallback response

### Requirement 3: Model Configuration Storage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all model parameters and configurations to be saved with the trained model, so that I can recreate the exact same architecture during inference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is saved THEN all LSMTrainer configuration parameters SHALL be serialized to a configuration file
2. WHEN a model is saved THEN reservoir type, architecture parameters, and hyperparameters SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN a model is loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically recreate the trainer with the exact same configuration
4. WHEN configuration is missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Inference Pipeline

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to input natural dialogue text and receive meaningful next-token predictions, so that I can interact with the trained model effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a dialogue sequence as text THEN the system SHALL automatically tokenize, process, and predict the next token
2. WHEN I use the interactive mode THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and provide continuous predictions
3. WHEN I provide batch input THEN the system SHALL efficiently process multiple sequences and return corresponding predictions
4. WHEN input format is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance on correct input format

### Requirement 5: Improved Model Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized model storage system, so that I can easily manage multiple trained models and their associated artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is saved THEN all artifacts SHALL be organized in a clear directory structure
2. WHEN multiple models exist THEN each SHALL have unique identifiers and metadata
3. WHEN listing available models THEN the system SHALL provide model information including training date, performance metrics, and configuration
4. WHEN a model directory is corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and report the issue clearly

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced system to work with existing trained models, so that I don't lose previous training work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading an old model without tokenizer THEN the system SHALL provide a migration path or clear instructions
2. WHEN old configuration formats are encountered THEN the system SHALL attempt to convert them to the new format
3. WHEN backward compatibility fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages explaining the issue
4. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL automatically upgrade old model formats to new standards

### Requirement 7: Performance and Memory Efficiency

**User Story:** As a user, I want inference to be fast and memory-efficient, so that I can use the model in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing inference THEN the system SHALL load only necessary model components
2. WHEN processing large batches THEN memory usage SHALL be managed efficiently
3. WHEN tokenizer operations are performed THEN they SHALL be optimized for speed
4. WHEN multiple inference requests are made THEN the system SHALL reuse loaded components efficiently

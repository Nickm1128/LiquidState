# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up and organizing the LSM (Liquid State Machine) project by removing legacy code, organizing the codebase into a proper structure, and adding essential development files like .gitignore. The project currently has scattered files, temporary directories, and lacks proper organization which makes it difficult to maintain and develop.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want legacy and temporary files removed from the project, so that the codebase is clean and only contains necessary files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove temporary test directories (production_test_*, production_validation_*)
2. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove log files that are not needed for production
3. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove duplicate or redundant test files
4. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove mock files that are no longer needed
5. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove batch/shell scripts that are environment-specific

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized into logical directories, so that I can easily navigate and understand the project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL create a src/ directory for main source code
2. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL create a tests/ directory for all test files
3. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL create a docs/ directory for documentation files
4. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL move core LSM files to appropriate directories
5. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL ensure examples remain in the examples/ directory
6. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL move configuration files to a config/ directory if needed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper .gitignore file, so that unnecessary files are not tracked in version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL ignore Python cache files (__pycache__/, *.pyc)
2. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL ignore log files (logs/, *.log)
3. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL ignore temporary directories and files
4. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL ignore IDE-specific files
5. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL ignore build and distribution directories
6. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL ignore environment files and secrets

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure to follow Python best practices, so that the project is maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL ensure main package files are in a proper package structure
2. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL ensure __init__.py files are present where needed
3. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL ensure setup/configuration files are at the root level
4. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL ensure documentation is properly organized
5. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL maintain import compatibility after reorganization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want redundant and outdated files removed, so that the project only contains current and necessary code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify and remove duplicate test files
2. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify and remove outdated summary/report files
3. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify and remove temporary cache files
4. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL preserve essential configuration and setup files
5. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL preserve the most current version of similar files
